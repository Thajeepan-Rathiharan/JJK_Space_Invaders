# Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK) Space Invaders Game - Yuji vs Mahito

## About the project
This project is to show my understanding of the coding language Python by making a space invaders clone using anime characters from the show 'Jujutsu Kaisen'.

## Created using
1. Visual Studio Code editor
2. Git source control
3. Python

## Outcome
I have proven to myself that I can understand Python to the ability that I can create a space invaders game in a unique style using anime characters and can understand the functions used by knowing what each part of the code does.

## Credits
I followed the space invaders game code guide from the [GeeksForGeeks tutorial website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-space-invaders-using-pygame-python/). The audio used in this project was also taken from the GeeksForGeeks website too.

The images I used were from the internet and I would like to give credit to the website(s) I found them from as I do not own the images used in this project:
