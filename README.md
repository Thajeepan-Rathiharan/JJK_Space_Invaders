# Jujutsu Kaisen (JJK) Space Invaders Game - Yuji vs Mahito

## About the project
This project is to show my understanding of the coding language Python by making a space invaders clone using anime characters from the show 'Jujutsu Kaisen'.

## How to play
You use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move Yuji left and right to manouver away from the enemy Mahito's, and use the space bar to shoot at them to prevent them from coming near you.

## Created using
1. Visual Studio Code editor
2. Git source control
3. Python

## Outcome
I have proven to myself that I can understand Python to the ability that I can create a space invaders game in a unique style using anime characters and can understand the functions used by knowing what each part of the code does.

## Credits
I followed the space invaders game code guide from the [GeeksForGeeks tutorial website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-space-invaders-using-pygame-python/). The audio used in this project was also taken from the GeeksForGeeks website too.

The images I used were from the internet and I would like to give credit to the website(s) I found them from as I do not own the images used in this project:
- [Yuji png image](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Yuji_Itadori)
- [Yuji's knife png image](https://katana-anime.com/products/epee-yuji-itadori-jujutsu-kaisen)
- [Mahito png image](https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Mahito)

[Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/resize) was used to resize the images from their original size to smaller sizes, Yuji and Mahito being shrunk down to 64x64 (width x height), and Yuji's knife being shrunk down to 32x32 (width x height).

The background music used in this project was sourced from a [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-423773476/jujutsu-kaisen-background-music-download-free-download) project.
